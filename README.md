# KeePass-Downloader
Downloads KeePass databases from SFTP server and automatically opens them in KeePass. Must be built from source because of variables which have to be changed!

The Variables which should be changed are all listed in "Program.cs"

It is called "Usb Auth" because it was originally made for me to access my KeePass database from whereever I was. 
I had a USB Key loaded with this and KeePass portable in the same directory. If I had to access my database from another computer than my own I would open this, type my server password and it would open the database file for me.
